# Python Lambda with MongoDb

> [!TIP]
> To deploy this project using **GUI-based flow**, navigate to [console](https://console.stacktape.com/create-new-project/git-project-using-console?name=my-stacktape-app&repositoryType=public&repositoryUrl=https://github.com/stacktape/starter-python-lambda-api)

- simple Lambda-based HTTP API using Python runtime.
- The application runs in a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/lambda-functions/) and uses
  [DynamoDb](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/dynamo-db-tables/) to store the data. To simplify
  the database access, this project uses [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing

- Fixed price resources:

  - **MongoDb Atlas cluster** ($0.012/hour, ~$9/month)

- There are also other resources that might incur costs (with pay-per-use pricing). If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS account**. If you don't have one, [create new account here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

2. **Stacktape account**. If you don't have one, [create new account here](https://console.stacktape.com/sign-up).

3. **Stacktape installed**.

4. **MongoDb Atlas account**. To create one, refer to our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/mongo-db-atlas-credentials/).


## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId python-lambda-api
```

## 2. Before deploy
- Fill in your MongoDb Atlas credentials in the `providerConfig.mongoDbAtlas` section of the stacktape.yml config file. To learn how to get your API keys and organization ID, refer to [MongoDB Atlas tutorial](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#std-label-atlas-prog-api-key). - Install your projects dependencies. The recommended way is to use [Virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

## 3. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- [Python version > 3.9](https://www.python.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) package manager installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

## 4. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

To test the application, you will need the web service URL. It's printed to the terminal.

### Create a post
Make a `POST` request to `<<web_service_url>>/post` with the JSON data in its body to save the post. Use your preferred HTTP client or
the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "title": "MyPost", "content": "Hello!", "authorEmail": "info@stacktape.com"}'
```

If the above cURL command did not work, try escaping the JSON content:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ \"title\":\"MyPost\",\"content\":\"Hello!\",\"authorEmail\":\"info@stacktape.com\"}'
```

### Get all posts

Make a `GET` request to `<<web_service_url>>/posts` to get all posts.

```bash
curl <<web_service_url>>/posts
```

## 5. Run the application in development mode
To run functions in the development mode (remotely on AWS), you can use the
[dev command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/dev/). For example, to develop and debug lambda function `savePost`, you can use

```bash
stacktape dev --region <<your-region>> --stage <<stage>> --resourceName savePost
```

The command will:
- quickly re-build and re-deploy your new function code
- watch for the function logs and pretty-print them to the terminal

The function is rebuilt and redeployed, when you either:
- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

## 6. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 7. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 HTTP API Gateway

API Gateway receives requests and routes them to the container.

For convenience, it has [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) allowed.

```yml
resources:
  mainApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 1.2 MongoDB Atlas cluster

The application data is stored in an Atlas MongoDB cluster.

Only the cluster tier needs to be configured in a minimal setup. You can also configure
[other properties](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters/) if desired.

```yml
mongoDbCluster:
  type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
  properties:
    clusterTier: M2
```

### 1.3 Functions

The core of our application consists of two serverless functions:

- **savePost function** - saves post into database(DynamoDB)
- **getPosts function** - get all posts from the database(DynamoDB)

Functions are configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the lambda artifact is built. The easiest and most optimized way to build the lambda is
  using `stacktape-lambda-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`. Stacktape automatically builds the
  application code with all of its dependencies, creates the lambda zip artifact, and uploads it to a pre-created S3
  bucket on AWS. You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-lambda-functions).
- **ConnectTo list** - we are adding dynamo table `mainDynamoDbTable` into `connectTo` list. By doing this, Stacktape
  will automatically setup necessary IAM permissions for the function's role as well as inject relevant environment
  variables into the runtime (such as table name).
- **Events** - Events determine how is function triggered. In this case, we are triggering the function when an event
  (HTTP request) is delivered to the HTTP API gateway:

  - if URL path is `/posts` and HTTP method is `POST`, request is delivered to `savePost` function.
  - if URL path is `/posts` and HTTP method is `GET`, request is delivered to `getPosts` function.

  The event(request) including the request body is passed to the function handler as an argument.

```yml
savePost:
  type: function
  properties:
    packaging:
      type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
      properties:
        entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/save-post.py
    memory: 512
    connectTo:
      - mongoDbCluster
    events:
      - type: http-api-gateway
        properties:
          httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
          path: /posts
          method: POST

getPosts:
  type: function
  properties:
    packaging:
      type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
      properties:
        entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/get-posts.py
    memory: 512
    connectTo:
      - mongoDbCluster
    events:
      - type: http-api-gateway
        properties:
          httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
          path: /posts
          method: GET
```
